I might have caused a lot of chaos in your life, might have added extra responsibility/burden on your head, might have just ruined your peace sometimes and many more, but I promise, I would give you the best life you deserve and fill your life with all the happiness I can afford. I promise to go to any extent just to see that cute and beautiful smile on your face. I love you to the moon and back, now and forever. Happy Birthday once again my love. May all your dreams come true. You deserve the world and I promise to give you that and much more. Here's to many more birthdays together, filled with love, laughter, and endless adventures. Cheers to you, my beautiful Shivangi! ðŸ’–"
